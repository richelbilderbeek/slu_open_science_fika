## Response to letter

I think the proposal by KB
is a step in the right reaction,
completely unconvincing to any critical reader, 
and has no effect on the most prevalent problems.
I will clarify my points here, in the hope to convince KB to make some changes.
However, I can imagine there is an unpublished strategy behind this proposal
and I will definitely give KB the benefit of the doubt in being 
more strategic than I am.
Whatever KB chooses to do, I will applaud their push for more Open Science.

I think the proposal by KB
is a step in the right reaction: to me, 
Open Science is a pleonasm, so making science more Open
is making science more what it should be.
Such a transition takes time and multiple steps.
The six focus area in the proposal are simply that:
the next steps. The next steps, after which there will be more.
This is similar to the advice given to researchers 
that just discovered Open Science:
do one step at a time and gradually build up the Openness
of your research.
I agree that the steps suggested by KB are steps in the right direction,
I can (and will) challenge that it is steps that should be first. 

I think the proposal by KB is unconvincing
to any critical reader, as it only mentions things as 
'increasing transparency'.
